# RISC-V-Simulator
#### Academic Project

A simple RISC-V simulator which performs the following two tasks:
1. Load a specified RISC-V text file (binary) and generate the assembly code equivalent to the input file (disassembler).
2. Generate the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the RISC-V code (simulator). Print the contents of registers and data memories after execution of each instruction.
